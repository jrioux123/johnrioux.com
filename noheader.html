   <p>Hey, A.V. Club reader. This is it. Our site is now live on Kinja, bringing The A.V. Club into the same publishing fold as the rest of our new friends at the Gizmodo Media Group, and completing a transformation that has been many arduous, anxious months in the execution. We’re gonna try not to break it.</p>
   <p>If you’re just joining us for the first time, hello! We’re The A.V. Club, a site written by the pop culture obsessive for the pop culture obsessed. Please have a look back through our two decades of online coverage on film, TV, music, games, food, books, comics, podcasts, and all other facets of the cultural dialogue so you can get caught up. We look forward to getting to know you, then confusing you with all of our inside jokes.</p>
   <p>If you’re a longtime follower, hey, welcome back! We’re still tweaking the site here and there to better organize our content and to make it as user-friendly for you as possible—it’s a process, as they say—but overall, we’re excited to explore the various bells and whistles this new system affords us. We’re also very grateful to the many people who made it happen, particularly our tech and graphics teams. Although everything looks different, all the stuff you remember is still there. And in the days and weeks to come, you’ll find that we’re still delivering the same criticism, commentary, and conversation you’ve come to expect. Today, we’re kicking things off with an extensive oral history of Battle Of The Network Stars, an Inventory of revamps that turned out better than anticipated, and a For Our Consideration on coping with change through pop culture. (Look, this is a little weird for us, too.)</p>
   <p>Finally, if you haven’t already signed up for a Kinja account, either as a new user or through your A.V. Club username, there’s instructions below on how to do that. You will have until 11:59 p.m. Eastern on Monday, September 25, to follow these instructions, after which these claim pages will no longer be available. Nothing you do here will affect your Disqus account or any comments you’ve made elsewhere using Disqus. You’ll also be happy to know that your fellow commenter Tyler Scott (a.k.a. Mark Bowen) took it upon himself to build a nifty Chrome extension that will nest Kinja comments, which might make you feel more at home. As we promised, all your comments on Disqus will migrate over to the new site, and you’ll see those start trickling in tomorrow.</p>
   <p>Let us know that you made it safely. Then we can get started.</p>
