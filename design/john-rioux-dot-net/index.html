                <p>In 2012, when my 13-year-old self became tired of making comics for an audience of no one, I created a <a href="https://johnrcomics.blogspot.com/">website</a> using Google's Blogger. As I grew disgusted by the aesthetics of a default Blogger site, I delved into its customization tools and started learning how to use CSS. Eventually I reached the limits of Blogger's customization options, and I decided I needed to create my own website from scratch.</p>
                <p>In 2015, I discovered <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, a free web hosting service, and spent the next five years teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The result is the website you're on right now.</p>
                <div class="title">Design Philosophy</div>
                <p>My website is primarily based on Google's <a href="https://material.io/design/">Material Design</a> — specifically their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=32&v=Q8TXgCzxEnw&feature=emb_title">original implementation</a>, which was based heavily on paper and print aesthetics. While Google has since abandoned their focus on paper, I've doubled down on the motif. It creates a sense of tacility to the components of the site, and since they're designed to behave logically as if they were paper, the overall experience is clear and predictable for the user.</p>
                <p>The ultimate priority is to create a universal experience for desktop, tablet, and mobile users.</p>
