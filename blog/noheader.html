   <p>Welcome, reader, to the all-new johnrioux.net, the only site on the internet to enjoy content created by John Rioux. Except for YouTube. And, like, deviantART, I think.</p>
   <p>For those of you who’ve somehow arrived at this site without knowing who John Rioux is, John is a writer and filmmaker from Falmouth, Maine. He graduated from Falmouth High School in 2017. He hasn’t gotten into college yet, but he will as soon, he’s working on it, don’t worry about it.</p>
   <p>He’s made a number of short films in recent years, with varying degrees of online accessibility. The films he shows people are available here. He’s also written several comic books, short stories, poetry, and other works, (including this blog post, so he’s going to stop writing in the third person).</p>
   <p>For most of my life, I had my mind set on writing and illustrating comic books for a living. In 2012, I created a blog to start publishing my work online. This continued for about four years, until filmmaking and theater started to consume both my time and interest, at which point I stopped having anything to post on the blog with any regularity.</p>
