                <h1>A Universe of Self-Indulgence</h1>
                <div class="subtitle">2015 - 2019</div>
                <div class="title">Introduction</div>
                <p>Between 2017 and 2019, the vast majority of my creative output consisted of projects created simply for the amusement of myself and my friends, without much consideration for a larger audience. These were <a href="#">short films made as personal birthday gifts</a>, <a href="#">live shows put on as elaborate pranks</a>, a <a href="#">video game made entirely out of inside jokes</a>—projects with such a disparity between effort and purpose that this disparity has become an artistic statement in itself. Whatever claims to “irony” we made while doing this has surely been undercut by the sincerity with which we’ve kept the bit up. It’s pure self-indulgence.</p>
                <p>The problem is that none of these projects make any sense to include in a professional portfolio. There’s a movie here about a person going back in time to stop <a href="/portfolio/videos/please-hire-pat-hilling">one of my older movies</a> from being made. No one should be subjected to that. Yet, such a ridiculous amount of time was put into these projects, and with such a commitment to production value, that my portfolio feels entirely incomplete without them. So I’ve decided to compile them here, presented chronologically and with the absolute minimum amount of context I could possibly give so that an outsider can maybe understand what any of it is. Unless you’re one of maybe four people, nothing on this page was made with the intention of you seeing it, so if that somehow sounds more intriguing than deterring, please enjoy what has become <i>A Universe of Self-Indulgence.</i></p>
                <div class="title">Prologue: High school nonsense</div>
                <p>On the heels of our recent <a href="/portfolio/videos/please-hire-pat-hilling">short film</a>, my friend and collaborator Tom Adams and I entered our senior year of high school without any specific plans for another project. As a result, our creative energy found bizarre outlets, like class projects, where we became delighted by the idea of putting in unprecedented amounts of effort.</p>
                <p>These projects included a <a href="https://youtu.be/5BsqWt5elHY">short film about psychological conditioning <span class="material-icons">launch</span></a>, a <a href="https://youtu.be/ki7NOcqFE3E">radio play about the dangers of social media <span class="material-icons">launch</span></a>, a <a href="https://youtu.be/1BRMcvp96sU">"trailer" for a school dance <span class="material-icons">launch</span></a>, and an <a href="https://youtu.be/R6qw6kl22WY">elaborate lip-sync battle performance <span class="material-icons">launch</span></a> in which we somehow convinced our high school principal to jump through a hula-hoop.</p>

                <div class="title">World Without Warnock</div>
                <p>In the middle of that senior year—the week of mid-terms, to be exact—our mutual friend Jack Warnock went away on some sort of week-long community service trip or something. Jack was the third member of a group chat we created about a year prior called “Big Trouble in Little Caesars,” and in his absence, we felt it necessary to send him a ridiculously convoluted artistic tribute. Instead of studying for mid-terms, we spent the week exploring the capabilities of an instant messaging app as a storytelling device.</p>
                <p>Without further ado, presented in the same format that Jack received them, here are the five installments of <i>World Without Warnock:</i></p>
