                <div class="title">Synopsis</div>
                <p>In my senior year of high school—the week of mid-terms, to be exact—my friend Jack Warnock went away on a week-long community service trip. Jack and I were in a group chat with our mutual friend Tom created about a year prior called “Big Trouble in Little Caesars” (for reasons not worth explaining). In Jack's absence, Tom and I felt it necessary to send him a ridiculously convoluted artistic tribute. Instead of studying for mid-terms, we spent the week exploring the capabilities of instant messaging as a storytelling device.</p>
                <p>So without further ado, and presented in approximately the same format Jack received them, here are the five installments of <i>World Without Warnock:</i></p>

                    <p class="mid">Tom and John arrived at school on Tuesday morning and went about their regular routine. Initially, nothing seemed amiss, but they soon noticed that something was... missing.</p>
                    <p class="mid">It started when they were rapping.</p>
                    <img class="mid" src="images/2.jpg">
                    <p class="mid">"Yo my name is John, it's a really great day, now I'ma pass it to the Screenwriting TA" ♬</p>

                    <p class="mid">"Yo my name is Tom, and I don't want to trouble you, but I'ma pass it down to my boy JW" ♬</p>

                    <img class="mid" src="images/5.jpg">
                    <p class="mid">Then they realized what was wrong. They were without Warnock. They were one Little Caesar too few.</p>
                    <p class="bot">What are they going to do? Will they survive a week in a world without Warnock?</p>

                    <p class="mid">The next day, Tom and John decided that they needed to fill the large, gaping Jack-shaped hole in their lives.</p>
                    <img class="mid" src="images/8.jpg">
                    <p class="mid">New Jack joined Tom and John in all the activities that they had partaken in with old Jack. They had a grand old time. It was as if nothing had changed.</p>

                    <img class="mid" src="images/10.jpg">
                    <p class="mid">It was a sad time when New Jack had to leave them that evening. But then he revealed his reasons for leaving:</p>
                    <img class="mid" src="images/11.jpg">
                    <p class="bot">"Well boys," he said, putting on a strange hat. "I've got to go to my Big Lebowski Hating Club."<br><br>Tom, John, and Old Jack loved The Big Lebowski. This new Jack couldn't possibly be an apt replacement for Warnock. And so they were left once again with a hole in the trio and in their hearts.</p>

                    <p class="mid">"Johnny," said Tom with exasperation, "I just don't know what to do without Jack."</p>
                    <img class="mid" src="images/3.gif">
                    <p class="mid">"Perhaps we just need to take a walk," John said, timidly.</p>
                    <img class="mid" src="images/4.gif">
                    <p class="mid">And so, Tom and John meandered aimlessly into the woods, knowing not what there travels would bring them.</p>
